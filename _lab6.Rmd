This file is included as an example of a lab that is a work-in-progress. In other words, a file that you don't want to be rendered quite yet. To prevent rendering, 
add an underscore `_` to its filename, as I've done for this R Markdown document. Once you're done working on it, you can remove the underscore and re-build your site.

(Don't forget to make sure that this file is included in your navbar if you want to link to it from there!)
