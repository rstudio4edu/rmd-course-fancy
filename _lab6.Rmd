# Work in progress

This file is included as an example of a lab that is a work-in-progress. In other words, a file that you don't want to be rendered quite yet. To prevent rendering, 
add an underscore `_` to its filename, as I've done for this R Markdown document. Once you're done working on it, you can remove the underscore and re-build your site.

(Don't forget to make sure that this file is included in your navbar if you want to link to it from there!)

1. Your first question here.
2. You second question here.

</div>
```

<div class="question">
1. Your first question here.

2. You second question here.
